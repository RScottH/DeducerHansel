{"name":"DeducerHansel","tagline":"An econometrics plug-in package for the Deducer R-package","body":"The R statistical environment is free and very popular among statisticians and others for data analysis and development of statisitcal software. It can however be a steep learning curve for many to learn to efficiently use its powerful script commands.\r\n\r\nDeducerHansel is an econometrics-focused GUI plug-in package for the Deducer R-package. It adds a Hansel Analysis menu with additional statistical techniques that are popular in economics and various other fields. Unlike what's available in the base Deducer package, the Hansel Analysis menu can work with some time series and spatial data that do not come up in data frame objects. Working through the Hansel Analysis menu also has a notably different feel to the way the user interacts with it than what is currently available in the base Deducer package. \r\n\r\nThe Hansel Analysis menu provides access to R methods in a user-friendly way, in a way similar to [gretl] (http://gretl.sourceforge.net/), another econometrics-based free open-source software project (thus the name \"Hansel\" if you recognize the German fable). But unlike gretl, Hansel Analysis is built within the far more massive universe of R.  \r\n\r\nTo see some **screen shots** you can go to the [wix.com website for DeducerHansel] ( http://hasc57.wix.com/deducerhansel ).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n1. For some of the more basic modeling estimations, such as ordinary least squares, a \"pretty\" html presentation is provided in\r\n   addition to the classic R output.\r\n2. With the modeling estimation and subsequent plots and tests, a \"Commands Log\" tab is provided to show what R commands are used. \r\n3. For ordinary least squares regression there are more plots and more tests than available in the base Deducer package. Robust standard error options are made available on the dialog and explorer pages for models.\r\n4. Many of the automatically-generated plots are editable within DeducerHansel.\r\n5. Hypothesis testing regarding restrictions on coefficient parameters is done through straightforward typing of the\r\n   null hypothesis, e.g \"b(2) = 0\".\r\n6. For defining new variables to be used in a model, a scroll below the variable selector allow creation of those new variables. This replaces the \"Model Builder\" page in the base Deducer package.\r\n7. Time series data, panel data, and spatial data can be handled. When data comes in a format that is not a data frame, DeducerHansel allows the creation of a \"mirror\" which is a data frame clone for the purpose of choosing variables in the variable selector (a partial mirror clones just the variable names, a full mirror clones all of the data). Special methods for dealing time series data, panel data and spatial data are provided.\r\n8. The R console is ready for commands while DeducerHansel models are being explored-it is not \"locked\" as in the base Deducer package.\r\n9. In Windows operating systems, DeducerHansel can work with either the standard RGui console or RStudio through a \"floating menu\".This floating menu allows for submenus, which base-Deducer has difficulties with when adding its menu to the standard RGui console.\r\n10. Datasets found in installed packages can be selected through a nice scroller.\r\n11. Data retrieval from net sources (Oanda, St Louis FRED, and Yahoo!) is available (albeit getting data from St Louis FRED is currently not working due to changes in the web address for the data; the maintainer of getSymbols command is working on that).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pre-Installation requirements\r\nDeducerHansel has been succesfully tested in Windows and Mac OS-X environments. It may very well work fine in Linux also. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike the base Deducer package, DeducerHansel needs Java and R to run. More information about these installation issues can be found in [README.md document] (https://github.com/RScottH/DeducerHansel/blob/master/README.md) at the GitHub repository site for DeducerHansel.\r\n\r\nThe installation instructions in the next section should be sufficient to install the DeducerHansel package along with the Deducer package it builds upon and the JGR package for which it may be useful, or even necessary, to use.\r\n \r\nDeducer and DeducerHansel are most at \"home\" with the JGR console, for which a JGR launcher is convenient to have. It can sometimes be tricky getting the JGR launcher working in Windows, but in that environment one can still easily use DeducerHansel through a \"floating window\", available in the standard RGui console or RStudio. \r\n\r\nThe [README.md document] (https://github.com/RScottH/DeducerHansel/blob/master/README.md) at the GitHub repository site for DeducerHansel includes information on getting the JGR launcher. \r\n \r\n## Installation of DeducerHansel\r\nThe most convenient way to install the `DeducerHansel` package through GitHub is by using the package `devtools`,entering the following commands into R: \r\n\r\nIf you have not already installed `devtools`, then enter the following R command in your R console to do so:\r\n\r\n```R\r\ninstall.packages('devtools')\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some parts of this installation, please be patient; notably the installation of the magrittr package, as part of this installation, can take a while. \r\n\r\nAfter `devtools` has been installed enter the following R commands:\r\n\r\n```R\r\nrequire(devtools)\r\ninstall_github('RScottH/DeducerHansel')\r\n```\r\n\r\nDon't worry if there is a warning about Rtools being required to build R packages. For some parts of this installation also, please be patient; notably the installation of the zoo package, as part of this installation, can take a while. \r\n\r\n## Using DeducerHansel\r\nLoading the DeducerHansel package will get it running. The main menu for DeducerHansel is the Hansel Analysis Menu.\r\nThe [README.md document] (https://github.com/RScottH/DeducerHansel/blob/master/README.md) at the GitHub repository site for DeducerHansel, has information on getting to the Hansel Analysis menu, but by a little exploration of the available menus you will likely find it on your own.\r\n\r\n###The Reset button - An important tip for using data frames\r\nIf a data frame is added to your workspace, then it may not show up initially when you look at available data frames in the variable selector. Next to the scroller on available data frames is a reset button, which you can double-click to bring up the latest data frames and clear variable selections. \r\n\r\nThis is in contrast to what occurs in the base Deducer package, in which available data frames for the variable selector are updated automatically. That is not done in DeducerHansel so that choices of variables by the user would be remembered more frequently. Therefore as a user you can, for example, change from a binary logit specification to a binary probit one without re-selecting your variables. But it is at the cost of you needing to manually reset the available data frames when you adds one to the workspace (one exception-if the variable selector has not been previously opened then it will look for available data frames automatically).\r\n\r\n###Demonstration data\r\nThe [DEMONSTRATIONS.md document](https://github.com/RScottH/DeducerHansel/blob/master/DEMONSTRATIONS.md)  at the GitHub repository site for DeducerHansel, has information on how to get the datasets that have been frequently used to test and demonstrate the methods available in DeducerHansel.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\nThe author of the DeducerHansel package is<br /> \r\nR.
