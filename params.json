It adds a menu with additional statistical techniques that are popular in economics and various other fields. Unlike the base Deducer package, DeducerHansel can work with some time series dand spatial data that do not come up in data frame objects. DeducerHansel also has a notably different feel to the way the user interacts with it than what is currently available in the base Deducer package.   \r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nThe most convenient way to install the `DeducerhHansel` package through github is by using the package `devtools`,entering the following commands into R:\r\n\r\nFirst in R, if you have not already installed `devtools`, then enter the following R commands in your R console to do so:\r\n\r\n```R\r\ninstall.packages('devtools')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter `devtools` has loaded enter the following R commands:\r\n\r\n```R\r\nrequire(devtools)\r\ninstall_github('RScottH/DeducerHansel')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub for Mac or GitHub for Windows, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved. \r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe author of the DeducerHansel package is<br /> \r\nR.
