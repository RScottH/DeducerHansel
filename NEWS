     CHANGES IN DeducerHansel VERSION 0.4-3.001 (2015-08-22)

BUG FIXES
o When loading a dataset, there was a benign bug that produced an error message regarding an unexpected symbol in "capture.output( The object". That bug has been fixed. 
o The shutting down of graphics devices has been improved, correcting an error that sometimes occured on cancellation of an explorer window from the request                                         "rm(.hansel.working.env$plotPanelsDevNums)".
o Previously when loading datasets there was an indication that a mirrored object was created when sometimes it wasn't. That problem has been fixed and in general the information about a mirror object has improved.
o In collecting objects that contain time series data, zooreg objects have been included in lists in Hansel.java, DtoolsDataFromWeb.java, and DtoolsMirrorsFromZoots.java, correcting a bug that a dataset such as DJIA from the strucchange package could not be loaded since its class was "zooreg" in the first position and "zoo" in the second.
o Handling of leading or ending missing values in time series are handled through trimming them off before using the dataseries. This corrects a bug that series with such missing values could not be used in autocorrelation function plots or plots vs lag(s).
o In the plotting of a variable vs its lag and in the plotting of histograms, the title of the series did not always come out correctly-it sometimes came out in an ugly complicated raw variable-name form. That has now been corrected. 
o In creating a time-series mirror for a data frame, the partial mirror option was not working, but now it is.
o  In the page for loading from packages the manual entry boxes were made larger to see more of title text.
NEW CAPABILITIES
o For correlograms, the plot-window titles of the raw series and the squared series now include the data name instead of "given series".

      CHANGES IN DeducerHansel VERSION 0.4-2.002 (2015-08-15)

BUG FIXES
o The startup R file Deducer##.R was corrected for installation for gretlReadWrite, which needs to be
inside the OnLoad function to avoid an error in installation with OS-X. Thanks to Ian Fellows
for pointing out the existence of the error.



      CHANGES IN DeducerHansel VERSION 0.4-2.001 (2015-08-11)

      CHANGES IN DeducerHansel VERSION 0.4-1.003 (2015-08-09)


BUG FIXES

o Some scroll menus were adjusted to be bigger so that they would be more likely to be visible on OS-X.




      CHANGES IN DeducerHansel VERSION 0.4-1.002 (2015-08-08)

BUG FIXES

o Replaced termsList.getSelectedValuesList().toArray() with 
(the unforunately deprecated) termsList.getSelectedValues() in many java files.
The reason is that termsList.getSelectedValuesList().toArray() does not work on OS-X;
